Assumptions:

-> Patient zero and those that become infected go to the bathroom within the first 20 mins?
-> Will a passenger go to the bathroom? Distribution that a passenger goes to the bathroom: 
    Following source gives 4-10 times per day (average 6-7), so once or less expected in 2-4 hour time period:

Process:

-> Simulate length of flight (t_i) -> random select from "flights_southwest.csv". Use column "air_time"
-> Simulate proximity infection
    -> For each neighbor: p(infection) = f(t_i)
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution
-> Simulate bathroom infection
    -> For each passenger: p(infection) = (poission process of visits) * (exponential decay of contamination)
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution
-> Sort for layovers vs final destination
-> For remaining and infeccted, simulate layover waiting time -> normal distribution


-> Repeat for all infected until t_final = T = 48h = 2880
