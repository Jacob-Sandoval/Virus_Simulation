Assumptions:

-> Patient zero and those that become infected go to the bathroom at 20 min mark (gastrointestinal distress, waiting for seatbelt sign to turn off)
-> Seatbelt sign, no one goes potty in the first or last 20 min
-> Will a passenger go to the bathroom? Distribution that a passenger goes to the bathroom: 
    Following source gives 4-10 times per day (average 6-7), so once or less expected in 2-4 hour time period:

Process:

-> Simulate length of flight (t_i) -> random select from "flights_southwest.csv". Use column "air_time"
-> Simulate seat assignment: Airflow patterns means only row matters. 
    -> 1/3 change for window, 1 next-neighbor, 1 over-neighbor, 0 over-over-neighbor
    -> 1/3 chance for middle, 2 next-neighbors, 0 over-neighbors, 1 over-over-neighbor
    -> 1/3 chance for aisle, 1 next-neighbor, 2 over-neighbor, 2 over-over-neighbors
-> Simulate proximity infection
    -> For each neighbor: p(infection) = f(t_i, position)
        -> 
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution (example: (2,3,4))
-> Simulate bathroom infection
    -> For each passenger: p(infection) = (poission process of visits) * (exponential decay of contamination)
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution
-> Sort for layovers vs final destination
-> For remaining and infeccted, simulate layover waiting time -> normal distribution


-> Repeat for all infected until t_final = T = 48h = 2880
