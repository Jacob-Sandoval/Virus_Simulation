Process:

-> Simulate length of flight (t_i) -> random select from kaggle set
-> Simulate proximity infection
    -> For each neighbor: p(infection) = f(t_i)
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution
-> Simulate bathroom infection
    -> For each passenger: p(infection) = (poission process of visits) * (exponential decay of contamination)
    -> When infected, simulate incubation period -> triangle distribution
-> Sort for layovers vs final destination
-> For remaining and infeccted, simulate layover waiting time -> normal distribution


-> Repeat for all infected until t_final = T = 48
